## Quick Start
1. change the hyperparameters in main.py  
2. run `python main.py`

## Environment
Python=3.7  
Pytorch=1.7  
cuda=10.1  


## Others
By changing hypermarameter `network` in line 16 of `main.py`, the model can be **switched between CNN, RNN, and DNN**. 

The performance is evaluated on val set. 

The Acc score as well as loss will be plotted into .png file after training finishing.
